# calculator-app
Repository where I will start creating a basic calculator script to later on incorporate some medium to advanced level Python concepts.

Along the way, I will also use this project to practice my knowledge of Git by creating other branches, merging them, checking out to previous commits, and so on.

Eventually, I'd like to take on something similar to this in other languanges, like Go or Ruby, but for now, let's get started with Python!
